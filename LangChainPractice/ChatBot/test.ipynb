A user with professional access can create, edit, and publish sheets or apps, and make full use of the available features, including administration of a Qlik Sense site.\\n\\nAnalyzer access is allocated to an identified user to allow the user to access streams and apps in the hub. The analyzer access is intended for users who consume sheets and apps created by others. A user with analyzer access cannot create, edit, or publish sheets or apps, but can create and publish stories, bookmarks and snapshots based on data in apps. The user can also create bookmarks, print objects, stories, and sheets, and export data from an object to Excel.\n",
      "Viewer License: A Viewer license allows users to view and interact with Looker content such as reports, dashboards, and visualizations. Viewers can filter, drill down, and explore data, but they typically don't have the ability to create or modify content. This license is suitable for individuals who primarily need to consume and analyze data without authoring reports.\\n\\nExplorer License: An Explorer license extends the capabilities of a Viewer license. Users with an Explorer license can not only view content but also create their own ad-hoc reports and visualizations using Looker's intuitive interface. This license is useful for users who want to perform more in-depth analyses and create custom visualizations.\\n\\nDeveloper License: A Developer license is intended for power users or analysts who need to create and design advanced reports, data models, and complex visualizations. Users with a Developer license can build and modify Looker content, including defining new fields, metrics, and dimensions in the data model.\\n\\nFull Access License: The Full Access license combines the capabilities of Viewer, Explorer, and Developer licenses. Users with this license have complete access to the Looker platform, allowing them to consume, explore, and create content as needed.\\n\\nEmbed User License: Looker also provides an Embed User license for cases where you want to embed Looker content, such as reports and dashboards, within external applications or websites. Embed users typically interact with Looker content seamlessly within the context of another application.\n",
